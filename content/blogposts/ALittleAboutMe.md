## Brief Introductions

Talking about yourself can be incredibly difficult, especially if you're like me and slightly introverted. Only slightly introverted, mind you, as I can be fairly extroverted when the mood takes me. I suppose I'm feeling quite extroverted at the moment.

I'm Gavin Kenna, a 28-year-old Irish lad with a passion for software development, design, infrastructure and pasta. I've always had an interest in computers growing up, and I was first exposed to computers in the form of my dads' Commodore 64. For those too young to know what I'm talking about you owe it to yourself to go up to your parents attic and find your own families [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) (trust me, it's up there - everyone had one).

I got married a few months ago, back in October '20, to Emma. We both have a dog called Laurel, and he is an English Setter / Golden Retriever mix. He's also a big dope.

### The Seed

Back in 2004/2005, when I was 11 or so,  I was really big into playing [Tycoon/Business Sim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_simulation_game) games - you know those simulation games (that were largely text based) in which you ran a [theme park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_Park_(video_game)) , or a [hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_Hospital) or even a [business empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism_II).

A lot of these games were of course commercially available - simply walk into a standard brick-and-mortar game store and grab it off the shelf. But what was even more exciting were the online indie communities that were developing and self-publishing their own games via [Download.com](https://download.com) -- and a lot of these games were available for free, under the banner of "[Freeware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware)".

Now, to a working-class kid who had a huge interest in video games (but not a lot of pocket money) this was the holy grail : fun, addictive video games that were free.

Of course some games were better than others. Out of hundreds of games I downloaded and played, two really stuck out : [GameBiz](https://download.cnet.com/GameBiz-The-Magical-Years/3000-2119_4-10514503.html) and [Chart Wars 3](https://download.cnet.com/Chart-Wars-3/3000-2119_4-10514078.html). I quickly realised that these two games were made by the same company, [Osiris Games](https://download.cnet.com/developer/Osiris%20Games/i-83147/). After seeing their Download.com profile I noticed they had a website (osirisgames.com, which is now sadly defunct) that detailed all their games and their respective developers. What I found most amazing was that each game was written by a ***single person***, and not by a large team. Up until then I simply accepted that making video games was a Herculean task that was left to big video game studios, ala E.A or Activision.

I **needed** to know how these developers made videos games, so I promptly emailed the lead developer of Chart Wars 3, Rob Cooper, and asked him how the hell he made the game. And he replied.

### The Basics with Visual Basic

Rob was kind enough to reply to me and gave me tonnes of information on how he built Chart Wars 3. He informed me that he used a programming language called [VB6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) and he sent me the link to a book I should look into buying if I wanted to learn how to use VB6.

I Googled VB6 and saw it cost a few hundred Euro, so I thought to myself that there was no point pursuing learning VB -- until Microsoft announced their [Express Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio_Express).

Back in 2005 Microsoft decided to be really cool and release freeware versions of their popular Visual Studio IDE's, as a way to promote the new .Net versions of their languages. One of those Express Studios was for VB.net 2005 Express Edition.

After spending hours downloading it I installed it and spent weeks going through all of the documentation I could find. Over the following months I built note takers, phone books, basic calculators and clones of basic games like Pong.

These formative months solidified my passion for writing code. The ability to materialise ideas in the form of applications via code really appealed to me, but I always believed it was simply going to be a hobby, and I would have to find a "typical" job once I left school. That was until I signed up for [NFTE](https://www.foroige.ie/our-work/youth-entrepreneurship/what-foroige-nfte) with a friend.

### Coverting Code to Dough

Back in 2008 I signed up for NFTE(Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship) with a good friend. NFTE was a programme for secondary school students (high school students for Americans). The idea is to come up with a product and a business.

The majority of students typically create Arts & Crafts type products. For instance my wife Emma (who was also doing NFTE that year) created beautiful bespoke bookmarks.

My business partner and I were not artistic in any sense, so we had to look elsewhere, and we decided writing a Maths Video Game wouldn't be a bad idea. We settled on our market (schools), and the applications name (Maths Craze). Each PC would require its own software license, so for a school that could easily be 20 licenses.

The game would be installed on all PCs within a school, and an admin would set up individual teachers. Then each teacher would set up each child's account and set their current maths skill set.

We built the software over a period of three months and when it was time to sell we didn't know how well it would do. For some strange reason it did really well, we sold hundreds (yes hundreds) of copies all over the country, and we made a fair bit of money.

Due to our success we came first in the National NFTE awards for 2008 which was an absolute blast.

From all of this success I realised the potential of pursing programming as a career, and when I left school in 2010 I enrolled in my local college for Computer Science. After 4 years studying I achieved a 3.8 GPA and got hired as a professional software engineer at Openet.

## Experience

I've been writing code for about 17 years now, and I've worked professionally for about 7 years. I've designed, written and deployed software for Telecommunications, Fintech and Medtech companies.

Most of my expertise is around backend development as well as DevOps. I'm not great at frontend development, but I'm able to make my way around a frontend codebase from time to time (hence the development of this website).

I'm a big fan of Java, especially with the Spring Framework.

## Tooling

So what do I use during my regular work day? Well just look below.

### Hardware

My work laptop is a Dell XPS 15 with Windows ripped out and Ubuntu 20.04 installed instead.

Keyboard is a [Razer Black Widow](https://github.com/GavinKenna/razer-blackwidow-ubuntu-keyboard). I have two, and it depends on my workplace. One is silent and one is CLICKY-CLICKY-CLACKY.

### Software

Software I use, in no particular order:

* [JetBrains IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - Just a great IDE. From college until my 3rd year in my first development job I exclusively used Eclipse as my Java/C++ IDE. I never understood why anyone would **pay** for their IDE. Yes Eclipse looked terrible and crashed all the time , but it was free, so I didn't mind. That changed when I saw a co-worker using IntelliJ, and it just looked so...useful. Been paying for it happily ever since.
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) - Need to quickly edit a file? Vim is your man.
* [Notable](https://notable.app/) - A beautiful note taking app.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - For when you need a lightweight editor (but heavier than Vim). I use this for writing my Markdown Blog posts.
* [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/) - Solid Linux OS, can't fault it.
* [Docker](https://docker.com) - Brilliant for development, production and hobby purposes. I use this daily in both my work and personal life.
* [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) - Same with Docker, I use this all the time for managing my Docker instances.
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - I don't use this in my personal life as I don't require it, but for development work it is so necessary.
* [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/ie/download/linux/) - Need some tunes.
