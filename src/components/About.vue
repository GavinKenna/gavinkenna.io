                        Hey there, I'm Gavin and welcome to my own little piece of the interwebs. I'm currently a
                        Director of Engineering for medtech company call PharmaPod, but I've previously held positions
                        as a Backend engineer, Architect, DevOps engineer and retail assistant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm using this site as a means to play around with Vue.js and hone my frontend skills, as I've
                        been mainly focusing on my backend and infrastructure skills the past few years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project is built using Vue.js, Bootstrap,  wrapped within a Docker container and
                        deployed on my trusty Raspberry Pi.
                    </p>
