                    Welcome to my little place on the internet. I plan on using this space to add Blog posts
                    that I find interesting, as well as a place to track my goals throughout the year.

                    Currently the site isn't much as it is the literal definition of a work in progress. I will be using
                    this site as a way to fully understand Vue.js.
